# Exception handling is a way to handle errors before they happen due to the unpredictability of external input and the possibility
# that "bad input" will be given to the program and cause an error. Exception handling provides a way for the program to deal with "bad input"
# so that instead of an error occuring and crashing the program, the program is able to run despite being given "bad input".
